Contact: Anne-Lyse Minard (minard[AT]fbk.eu)

Usage:
```
        -h           : print this message
        -g           : path to the folder containing gold files
        -s           : path to the folder containing system files
        -r           : path to the file in which the results will be printed
        -t           : path to a folder in which temporary files will be saved
```

To perform the evaluation of factuality annotation starting from CAT format files:
```
sh run_evaluation.sh -g gold/ -s system/ -r result_file -t temp/
```


The folder comtains the following scripts:

- run_evaluation.sh: to perform the evaluation of factuality annotation starting from CAT format files.

- cat_to_conll_converter.py: called by run_evaluation.sh to convert CAT-labelled format files into the CoNLL format.
To do only the conversion from the CAT-labelled format to the CoNLL format:
```
python cat_to_conll_converter.py folder_CAT/ folder_CoNLL/ FV_rules.txt
```

- scorer_factuality.pl: called by run_evaluation.sh to perform the evaluation of factuality starting from files in CoNLL format.
To run only the scorer:
```
perl scorer_factuality.pl gold_CoNLL/ sys_CoNLL/
```

- rules_FV.txt: contains the rules used by the scorer to compute the Factuality Value of an event using the values of the certainty, polarity and time attributes.
