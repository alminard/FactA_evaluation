Contact: Anne-Lyse Minard (minard@fbk.eu)

Usage:
```
        -h           : print this message
        -g           : path to the folder containing gold files
        -s           : path to the folder containing system files
        -r           : path to the file in which the results will be printed
        -t           : path to a folder in which temporary files will be saved
```

To perform the evaluation of factuality annotation starting from CAT format files:
```
sh run_evaluation.sh -g gold/ -s system/ -r result_file -t temp/
```


To convert CAT files into CoNLL column format.
```
python CAT_to_evaluation_formats.py folder_CAT/ folder_CoNLL/ FV_rules.txt
```

To perform factuality evaluation starting from CoNLL format files:
```
perl scorer_evaluation.pl gold_CoNLL/ sys_CoNLL/
```

The file rules_FV.txt contains the rules to compute the Factuality Value of an event using the values of the certainty, polarity and time attributes.
